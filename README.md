# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Hybrid-ML-Algorithms-with-Flask-App
A hybrid heart disease prediction system using Machine Learning and Deep Learning to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This project leverages AI to provide efficient, data-driven predictions, aiming to support early detection and reduce manual diagnostic errors.
Abstract:
This project presents a hybrid heart disease prediction system that integrates
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Patient medical data, including age, cholesterol, and ECG results, undergoes preprocessing and feature selection using methods like KNN , ML model XGBoost provide baseline predictions, while deep learning models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and 1D capture complex patterns. The final model is deployed via a Flask-based web application, enabling real-time predictions. This AI-driven approach improves early detection, aiding healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely decisions.
